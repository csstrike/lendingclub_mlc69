# Lending Club Case Study

> A consumer finance company specializes in lending various types of loans to urban 
customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to 
make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile
> The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which 
may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of 
loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc
